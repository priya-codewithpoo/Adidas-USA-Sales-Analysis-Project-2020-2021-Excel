## 💡 Project Summary

This project uses Excel and Power Query to analyze Adidas US sales (2020–2021). Interactive dashboards and per-capita metrics help identify potential markets for expansion

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates **hands-on Excel analytics using a multi-dimensional Adidas sales dataset. The goal was to simulate a real-world market review…** by cleaning raw data and building an interactive dashboard that focuses on **actionable insights** rather than just static charts.

The project is structured to answer high-impact business questions, specifically focusing on **Target Achievement** and **Market Penetration** by merging sales data with 2024 US Population estimates.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Apply **Power Query** to automate the cleaning and merging of fragmented datasets.
* Demonstrate advanced **Data Modeling** by connecting Sales, Population, and Target metrics.
* Think like a **Data Analyst** by developing a "Sales Per Capita" metric to identify untapped markets.
* Build an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to visualize key metrics.

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

* **Software:** Microsoft Excel (v2021/365)
* **Data Engine:** **Power Query** (M-Language) for ETL processes.
* **Concepts Used:**
    * Data Cleaning & Type Transformation (ETL)
    * Table Joins & Appending
    * DAX-style Pivot Calculations
    * Interactive Slicers & Timeline Filters

## 📂 **Project Structure**

The project is contained within a single, highly-structured Excel Workbook. To maintain professionalism, the "Back-end" is separated from the "Front-end":

* **Dashboard**: The primary user interface with KPIs, Slicers, and Visualizations.
* **cleaned_data**: The final output of the Power Query ETL process.
* **calculation**: Dedicated sheet for target-tracking logic and per-capita math.
* **pivot data**: The engine room where all charts are calculated via Pivot Tables.
* **Data Folder**: Contains the original raw CSV files used for the analysis.

## 📈 **Business Insights Covered**

* **Target vs. Actual Performance:** Tracked $899.9M revenue against a $900M goal (99.99% achievement) to evaluate overall sales performance.

* **Market Penetration (Sales Per Capita):** Normalized sales by state population to identify underperforming regions with high potential.

* **Regional Revenue Analysis:** Compared revenue across West, Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions to highlight strong and weak markets.

* **Product Category Performance:** Identified which categories (Apparel vs. Footwear) contribute most to revenue and margins.

* **Sales Channel Efficiency:** Analyzed In-store, Online, and Outlet channels to determine the most effective sales methods.

## 🧠 **Key Learnings**

* **Automating ETL:** Moving from manual cell edits to a "Refreshable" Power Query pipeline.
* **Strategic Metrics:** Understanding that "Total Sales" is less important than "Sales per Capita" for expansion.
* **Dashboard:** Learning how to lock charts and objects to create a foolproof tool for executives.
